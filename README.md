# dotfiles
## Introduction
This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Linux.
It takes the effort out of installing everything manually.
Everything needed to install my preferred setup of Xubuntu is detailed in this readme.
Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Enjoy!
